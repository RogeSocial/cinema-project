# **Cinema Project**

## **Introduction**

"This project was built as a graded assignment by a team of full-stack developer students. The primary focus of the project was to enhance the team's collaboration skills using Git and to familiarize themselves with the SCRUM framework. The Agile process was carried out in two sprints, followed by a week of performance analysis and workflow evaluation.

The app was designed to meet the graded requirements, including full responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, and a modern user interface with efficient routing. The project provided an excellent opportunity for the team to apply their skills while enhancing their understanding of the Agile methodology."

## **Description**

We decided to build a niche cinema application, specifically catering to fans of horror films. The app was built using React and integrated with a pre-existing API; the selection of available movies was added manually to the database.
